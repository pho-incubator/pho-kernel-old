## /cache folder

This is the directory where the [user-space nodes and edges](http://www.phonetworks.org/kernel) are placed.

Default schema files can be found in the /graphql folder of this Pho-Kernel package. You need [pho-cli](https://github.com/phonetworks/pho-cli) to compile schema files into executable PHPs.
